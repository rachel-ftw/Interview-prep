# interview-practice

## Description

HackerRank recently introduced a module called [**Cracking the Coding Interview**](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview/status/all/page/1). For those thinking about delving more deeply into the algorithms and data structures concepts they've missed out on, this challenge is for you. 

COMMITTING TO COMPLETING: 

1. **Breadth** provides a gentle introduction to several different algorithms and data structures concepts.
2. **Depth** focuses on gaining a deep knowledge of a particular category of algorithms (e.g., sorting algorithms) or data structures (e.g., binary trees).


## Specifications

**Breadth:**

- [ ] Solve the 4 Easy challenges and 3 Medium challenges under the "Data Structures" section: 

   **Easy (solve all):**
   [Arrays: Left Rotation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation)
   [Strings: Making Anagrams](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-making-anagrams)
   [Hash Tables: Ransom Note](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ransom-note)
   [Linked Lists: Detect a Cycle](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-linked-list-cycle)

   **Medium (solve all):**
   [Stacks: Balanced Brackets](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-balanced-brackets)
   [Queues: A Tale of Two Stacks](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-queue-using-two-stacks)
   [Trees: Is This a Binary Search Tree?](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree)

- [ ] Solve 2 out of the 3 Medium challenges under the "Algorithms" section

   **Medium (solve 2):**
   [Sorting: Bubble Sort](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-bubble-sort)
   [Sorting: Comparator](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-comparator-sorting)
   [Binary Search: Ice Cream Parlor](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-ice-cream-parlor)

- [ ] Solve the 2 Easy challenges under the "Techniques/Concepts" section and 1 out of 2 Medium Challenges

   **Easy (solve all):**
   [Recursion: Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-fibonacci-numbers)
   [Bit Manipulation: Lonely Integer](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-lonely-integer)
   
   **Medium (solve 1):**
   [Time Complexity: Primality](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-big-o)
   [Recursion: Davis' Staircase](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-recursive-staircase)

**Depth:**

- [ ] Choose one of the following subdomains in HackerRank's [Algorithms](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/warmup) domain, and solve 10 problems within each domain:

   [Strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/strings/difficulty/all/page/1)
   [Sorting](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/arrays-and-sorting/difficulty/all/page/1)
   [Search](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/search/difficulty/all/page/1)
   [Graph Theory](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/graph-theory/difficulty/all/page/1)
   [Greedy](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/greedy/difficulty/all/page/1)
   [Dynamic Programming](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms/dynamic-programming/difficulty/all/page/1)

   NOTE: there are no "easy" Dynamic Programming problems, at least according to HackerRank. :p

- [ ] Provide a working implementation of the data structure of your choice and solve 6 challenges related to that data structure. If the HackerRank or LeetCode links do not contain 6 challenges, use the data structure to solve another challenge you find on HackerRank or somewhere else on the internets. 

   Choose from the following:

      [Dynamically-sized list](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/arrays)
      [Linked List](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/linked-lists)
      [Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trees)
      [Balanced Binary Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/balanced-trees)
      [Stack](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/stacks)
      [Queue](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/queues)
      [Heap](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/heap)
      [Trie](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/data-structures/trie) and [Trie (LeetCode)](https://leetcode.com/tag/trie/)
      [Graph (LeetCode)](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/)





Feel free to substitute any one challenge for a challenge of a higher difficulty level.
